# 유비무환 프로젝트
- 목표 달성을 위한 ToDoList 앱
- React와 ES6 문법들에 대해 좀 더 연습하고자 진행했던 프로젝트이다.
- 매번 따라 치기만 했지 실제 뭔가를 구상하고 고민하면서 하려니 손이 안움직이더라 ㅋㅋㅋ 역시 프로젝트 한번 하는게 짱인거 같다.
- 잘 알지 못하고 마음대로 안되는 부분들도 많았지만,
- 하나 하나 검색해가면서 안써본 hooks들도 써보고 많이 도움이 되었던 것 같다.

왠지 감성적인게 더 잘어울린다..



### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
